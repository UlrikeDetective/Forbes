300001,81.411
300002,81.411
etc.

Dataset Description
The dataset for this competition (both train and test) was generated from a deep learning model trained on the Student Bag Price Prediction Dataset dataset. Feature distributions are close to, but not exactly the same, as the original. Feel free to use the original dataset as part of this competition, both to explore differences as well as to see whether incorporating the original in training improves model performance.

Files
train.csv - the training dataset; Price is the target
train_extra.csv - a whole lot more training data!
test.csv - the test dataset; your objective is to predict the Price for each row
sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format.
